# Cost

- Almost everything in the cloud costs money (exceptions exists such as resource groups)

## Pricing Models

- Per resource, ie. VM
- Per consumption, ie. Function Apps
- Reservation: we pay upfront with a commitment of using that resource for a certain amount of time (for example 3 years)

## Rules of thumb

- Always check resource's cost before provisioning
- Check for cost-effective alternatives
- Look for reservations when available and relevant

- Budgets are alerts (email notifications) that can we set to get notified if the costs exceed a certain value
