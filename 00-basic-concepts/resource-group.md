# Resource Groups

- A logical container for resources used for grouping resources by a logic boundary
- It is completely free
- Examples:
    - Development/Test/Production
    - Team A resources
- Almost every resource in Azure is placed in a resource group

## Resource Groups vs Subscriptions vs Management Groups

- Subscription are a cost center, they have associated accounts
- The cost is always per subscription
- Subscriptions can have multiple resource groups
- It s a place to manage subscriptions

## Resource Groups naming conventions

- It is a best practice to have an `rg` or `RG` as part of the resource group name
- This could be either suffix or prefix
